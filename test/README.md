- **Comprehensive Extraction**: Passwords, Cookies, Autofill Data
- **Multiple Output Formats**: TXT, CSV, JSON
- **Professional Interface**: Colored output, progress tracking, logging
- **Easy Execution**: One-click batch file execution
- **Educational Purpose**: Combines best practices from 16+ analyzed projects

## üìã Requirements

- **Windows OS** (Windows 10/11 recommended)
- **Python 3.7+** installed
- **Administrator privileges** (recommended for best results)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Download/Clone** this repository
2. **Extract** to a folder of your choice
3. **Run** `run_extraction.bat` - dependencies will be installed automatically

## üéØ Quick Start

### One-Click Execution (Recommended)
```bash
# Simply double-click or run:
run_extraction.bat
```

The batch file will:
- Check for Python installation
- Install required dependencies automatically
- Run the full extraction process
- Open the output directory automatically
- Display completion summary

### Manual Execution (Advanced Users)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the extractor
python main.py
```

## üìÅ Output Files

The tool generates the following files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `extracted_passwords.txt` | Detailed password list with metadata |
| `extracted_passwords.csv` | CSV format for analysis/import |
| `extracted_cookies.txt` | Detailed cookie list with metadata |
| `extracted_cookies.json` | JSON format for easy import |
| `extraction_summary.txt` | Summary report of extraction results |
| `extraction.log` | Detailed extraction log |

## üîß Technical Details

### Supported Browsers
- **Google Chrome**: Full password and cookie extraction
- **Microsoft Edge**: Full password and cookie extraction  
- **Brave Browser**: Full password and cookie extraction
- **Opera**: Full password and cookie extraction

### Encryption Support
- **AES-GCM**: Modern v20 encryption format
- **Legacy DPAPI**: Fallback for older formats
- **Multi-format**: Handles v10, v20, and legacy encryption

### Extraction Process
1. **Process Termination**: Safely closes browser processes
2. **Key Extraction**: Retrieves encryption keys from Local State
3. **Database Access**: Copies SQLite databases to avoid locks
4. **Decryption**: Decrypts passwords and cookies using AES-GCM
5. **Output Generation**: Creates multiple output formats

- Delete extracted files when no longer needed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Python is not installed"**
- Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Ensure Python is added to system PATH

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Run as administrator for best results
- Some extractions may fail without admin privileges

**"No passwords/cookies found"**
- Ensure browsers are closed before running
- Check if browsers have saved passwords/cookies
- Verify browser installation paths

**"Dependencies installation failed"**
- Check internet connection
- Try running: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install dependencies manually: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## üìä Performance

- **Extraction Speed**: ~2-5 seconds per browser profile
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (< 50MB)
- **File Size**: Output files typically < 1MB
- **Compatibility**: Windows 7+ (tested on Windows 10/11)
